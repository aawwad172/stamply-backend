# Product Guidelines: Stamply

## Tone & Voice
Stamply's voice is **welcoming and trustworthy**. We aim to build a sense of community and reliability between businesses and their customers. Our communication should be encouraging and supportive, making both business owners and users feel confident in the digital loyalty experience.

## Branding
**Stamply Branding First:** While we support and empower businesses, the Stamply brand should be prominent as a mark of quality and reliability. We provide a cohesive platform experience that customers can recognize across different merchants.

## UX Principles
- **Zero-friction Stamping:** The process of adding a stamp must be as fast and seamless as possible. Minimize the number of taps and interactions required for both the business staff and the customer.
- **Simplified Management:** The management interface for business owners must be intuitive and easy to use, regardless of their technical expertise. Prioritize clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Since the primary interaction happens on mobile devices (wallets and QR scanning), the design and UX must be optimized for mobile interactions first.

## Prose Style
- **Simple & Direct:** Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon and complex terminology.
- **Active Voice:** Use the active voice to make instructions and feedback feel immediate and actionable.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent terminology across the entire application and all documentation.
