# Stamply Product Guidelines

## 1. Tone and Voice
Stamply speaks with a **Friendly & Energetic** voice. We want our users to feel excited about earning rewards and our tenants to feel empowered.
- **Do:** Use active, positive language ("You're just 2 stamps away!", "Success! Your new loyalty program is live.").
- **Don't:** Use overly formal, dry, or robotic language that makes the reward process feel like a chore.

## 2. Visual Identity
Our design philosophy balances engagement with utility by being **Vibrant & Colorful** yet **Clean & Modern**.
- **For End-Users:** Use bold colors, playful animations (especially when a stamp is earned), and clear call-to-actions to make the digital card feel like a valuable asset.
- **For Tenants:** Maintain a clean dashboard with ample whitespace and clear data visualization. The interface should feel professional and easy to navigate during a busy shift.
- **Universal:** Prioritize clarity. Whether it's a "Scan Me" QR code or a "Redeem" button, the next step should always be obvious.

## 3. Brand Messaging
Our core value proposition is: **"Simple, Seamless, Sustainable."**
- **Simple:** The product should be intuitive for anyone to use without a manual.
- **Seamless:** The transition from a physical shop to a digital wallet should happen in seconds with zero friction.
- **Sustainable:** We take pride in helping small businesses reduce paper and plastic waste by digitizing loyalty cards.

## 4. User Experience Principles
- **Speed is King:** The primary goal is to minimize time-to-value. A user should be able to scan a QR code and add their card to Apple or Google Wallet in fewer than three taps.
- **The "Aha!" Moment:** The instant a stamp is scanned and the user's phone vibrates or shows a notification is our most important interaction. This feedback loop must be reliable and satisfying.
- **Empowerment:** Tenant tools should provide actionable insights (e.g., "Wednesday mornings are your quietest time; try a double-stamp promotion") rather than just raw data.
