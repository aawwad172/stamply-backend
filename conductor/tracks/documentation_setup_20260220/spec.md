# Specification: Update project documentation and README

## Overview
This track focuses on transitioning the project documentation from a generic .NET template to the specific "Stamply" Digital Loyalty System. This includes updating the main README.md and establishing a dedicated documentation structure.

## Scope
- Update `README.md` to reflect Stamply's vision, features, and setup.
- Remove outdated template instructions.
- Create a base for project-specific documentation (e.g., business rules).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `README.md` accurately describes Stamply.
- "Getting Started" in `README.md` is updated and reflects the current state.
- A new `docs/` folder exists with initial project documentation.
